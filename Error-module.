**1. The Error Module**

Resource: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error

Error objects are thrown when runtime errors occur. 
The Error object can also be used as a base object for user-defined exceptions. 
Javascript has several built-in error types. 
--Can be instantiated (Error class -- Error instance)
--Handle errors by try-catch block
--asynchronous Node API uses error-first callback functions as traditional try-catch statements may not work for asynchronous operations
