## Coolest question mark

Javascript ❓ operator has 3 special functionalities ❗
1. Ternary Operator (boolExpr ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse)
2. Optional chaining (object.mayNotExistProp?.someOtherProp)
3. Nullish Coalescing ( ifUndefined ?? useThisDefault) **-> which is more functional than || operator since it recognises 0 and ''**

Some facts:
- Array constructor allows varags
- support for...in... loop
- .length property is fairly useful

Methods:
- refer to source
